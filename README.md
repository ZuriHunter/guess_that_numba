<h1>Guess that Numba</h1>

<p>With the helpful use of AngularJS by Example, I was able to actually get a basic understanding of the steps needed to put together an angular app.  The purpose of this app is to give the user the opportunity to guess a number between 1-1000 (I know thats alot).  But with the help of some Javascript in the background and having it connected to the Angular framework it gives the ability to communicate to the user when their guess is too high, too low or just right! With this it also shows the number of tries the user has entered. </p>

<p>Hopefully, sometime down the road I am going to try to figure out how to simple just push this on to heroku or some hosting service.</p>
